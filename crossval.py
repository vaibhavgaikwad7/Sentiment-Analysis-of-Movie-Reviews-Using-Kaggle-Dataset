'''
  This program shell reads phrase data for the kaggle phrase sentiment classification problem.
  The input to the program is the path to the kaggle directory "corpus" and a limit number.
  The program reads all of the kaggle phrases, and then picks a random selection of the limit number.
  It creates a "phrasedocs" variable with a list of phrases consisting of a pair
    with the list of tokenized words from the phrase and the label number from 1 to 4
  It prints a few example phrases.
  In comments, it is shown how to get word lists from the two sentiment lexicons:
      subjectivity and LIWC, if you want to use them in your features
  Your task is to generate features sets and train and test a classifier.

  Usage:  python classifyKaggle.py  <corpus directory path> <limit number>

  This version uses cross-validation with the Naive Bayes classifier in NLTK.
  It computes the evaluation measures of precision, recall and F1 measure for each fold.
  It also averages across folds and across labels.
